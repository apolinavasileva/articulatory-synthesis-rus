# VocalTrax-RU: Articulatory Synthesis & Evaluation

This project explores articulatory speech synthesis using [VocalTrax (NeurIPS 2024)](https://vocaltrax.media.mit.edu/), an interpretable model of the vocal tract.

The study analyzes the strengths and limitations of the original framework and adapts VocalTrax to Russian speech by:
- building articulatory prototypes of Russian allophones from a phonetically balanced corpus,
- modeling reduction and palatalization via additional vocal tract constrictions,
- and evaluating synthesis quality with formant RMSE, MCD, and UTMOS.

## Project Status
This project is currently in development. The repository will be updated as new results become available: refined metrics, improved parameter mappings, and extended experiments with male/female vocal tract prototypes.
